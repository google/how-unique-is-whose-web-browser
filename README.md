# how-unique-is-whose-web-browser

This repository contains data analysis notebooks that assess how web browser fingerprinting risks differ by demographic groups.  In addition, they analyze the results of a survey and experiment designed to assess what impacts usersâ€™ likelihood to share their browser data to open research.

The analyses use open source data available at: https://github.com/aberke/fingerprinting-study 

These analyses contribute to a forthcoming paper.
